# VERIFICATION.md — Receipts (Primitive 10)

> Evidence, not claims. Nothing in `TASKS.md` becomes ✅ without a row here.
> A receipt is something the owner can re-run or look at: build output, test output,
> a curl transcript, a screenshot. "It works" is not a receipt.
> Scrub tokens/secrets before pasting transcripts.

## Receipt types (pick at least one per task)

| Type | Good for | Minimum content |
|---|---|---|
| Build | any code change | the actual command + exit-clean output |
| Test | logic | command + pass summary (paste failures in full if any) |
| Curl transcript | endpoints | request + response body (status visible) |
| Screenshot | UI | file path or embedded image; state shown must match the AC |
| Migration round-trip | schema | up → down → up output |

### F-25 — Customer orders-&-tracking page-plan set (merged `/orders`, 4 docs) · 2026-07-19
**AC:** Folder holds `customer_orders_tracking_PLAN.md` (source of truth: FE+BE contract incl. the single monitor-SSE stream + 2 cancel writes, 15-behavior spec, 6 named loading branches, TASKS.md row mapping, 14 defects designed out) + `_plan.html` + `_how-it-works.html` + `_mockup-1.html`, all rendering both themes (mockup on the customer dark/orange shell); zero rule duplication (links owning docs); indexes updated per Hard Rule 6.

```
Built with 2 Explore agents (digest of the tracking + order_list + order_detail corpora) + 2 builder agents (the 3 HTML companions). Registered per Hard Rule 6: 4 rows in CONTEXT_MAP.md §Doc inventory + a new "Realtime" routing row + 4 rows in README.md §plans/.
Also registered a new **Phase R** in TASKS.md (R-1 realtime platform + monitor SSE; R-2 FE live half) and **split O-3** (was one row for two ACs — static half stays O-3, live half → R-2).
Reconciliation highlights (§3.4/§6): reference order-in-`useState` → TanStack Query (SSE only triggers refetch) · duplicate OrderDetailSheet+`/order/:id` → one inline detail component (kills the 🔴 404-wedge) · FE-invented queue position/ETA → BE-computed (one event contract) · `order.status` name drift → exhaustive consumer switch (CI-gated) · ungated SSE → own-order/table gate · `{data:…}` on GET but bare on POST → never wrap success · "Xoá lịch sử" orphaned `activeOrderId` → clears the pointer · hidden nhân/note → rendered from `toppings_snapshot`.
Open flags for owner (§7): ⚠ cancel rule 3-way (ref `<30%` vs owner "before payment" — plan defaults owner's, one `canCancel` predicate, lock before O-2) · ⚠ money glyph `đ` vs `₫` (one `formatVND()`; plan defaults menu's `đ`) · ⚠ route reconciliation (menu plan redirects to `/order/<id>`; this screen is `/orders` via `activeOrderId` — recommend menu handoff → `/orders`, not edited here) · ❓ `item_progress` smooth-patch vs refetch (confirm at R-1).

### F-23 — Admin-staff page-plan set (4 docs, one folder) · 2026-07-19
**AC:** Folder holds `admin_staff_PLAN.md` (source of truth: 6-endpoint manager+ FE+BE contract, the 4 guards, reference error codes mapped onto the BE_STATE §4 9-code enum, 20-behavior spec, S/AD task mapping, 17 reference defects designed out) + `_plan.html` + `_how-it-works.html` + `_mockup-1.html`, all rendering both themes (mockup on the neutral F-7 admin tokens, NOT the customer dark/orange shell); every reference flag gets an adopt/fix/drop ruling; zero rule duplication (links owning docs); indexes updated per Hard Rule 6.
**Receipt:**

each HTML footer: "snapshot of admin_staff_PLAN.md, which wins on any conflict"
```
Registered per Hard Rule 6: 4 rows in CONTEXT_MAP.md §Doc inventory + 4 rows in README.md §plans/.
Reconciliation highlights (§3.4/§6): raw-SQL repo → goose+sqlc · client 100-row cap → server-side
paging (URL-owned per FE_STATE §9.2) · unrevoked refresh tokens → same-tx delete on deactivate/delete ·
soft-delete UNIQUE trap → `<username>#deleted-<id>` rename · `performance_score:0` phantom → dropped ·
loading≡empty≡no-match conflation → 5 named branches · stuck detail drawer → named error branch.
Open flags for owner: ⚠ shared `CONFLICT` code needs a `details[].issue` discriminator (or 2 new enum
codes) · ⚠ RBAC role-level table needs a permanent home (proposed OVERALL_PLAN §3) · ❓ no password-reset
path anywhere in the reference — assumed v1 gap (admin resets via DB) unless S-4 adds it.
**Verdict:** AC met — F-23 is a planning deliverable (no runnable code); receipt is the 4-file render check above.

### F-26 — Admin-training page-plan set (4 docs, one folder) · 2026-07-19
**AC:** Folder holds `admin_training_PLAN.md` (source of truth: FE+BE contract, 10-endpoint table incl. the staff watch/quiz write path the reference never built, the roster-first progress reads, derived 4-state completion status, 12-behavior spec, AD-T1…AD-T6 task mapping, 19 defects designed out) + `_plan.html` + `_how-it-works.html` + `_mockup-1.html`, all rendering both themes (mockup on the neutral F-7 admin tokens, NOT the customer dark/orange shell); every reference bug mapped to a countermeasure; zero rule duplication (links owning docs); indexes updated per Hard Rule 6.

wide content wrapped in overflow-x:auto (tables + SVG sequence diagrams)
customer-orange bleed (#f97316/#0b0f17): 0 in every file  (admin = neutral F-7)
footer on all 3 HTML: "snapshot of admin_training_PLAN.md, which wins on any conflict"
```
**Digest:** 13 reference docs (`08_pages/admin/admin_training/` ×7 + `fe/wireframes/admin_main/admin_main_training/` ×6) read in full; the first delegated digest agent + two of three HTML builders died on the session usage limit, so the digest and `how-it-works.html` were produced inline (the `_plan.html` + `_mockup-1.html` builders landed their files before failing).
**Headline finding designed out:** the reference page was a working guide-authoring CMS bolted onto a **dead** tracking shell — no API path ever wrote `training_progress`/`quiz_attempts`, so 3 of its 7 endpoints returned empty/404 forever. Plan blocks the tracking UI (AD-T6) on the staff write path (AD-T4) so it never ships inert; roster-first LEFT JOIN replaces the reference's permanently-empty INNER JOIN.
**Verdict:** AC met — 4-doc set complete + registered. TASKS.md row marked 🔄 (planning done; AD build rows AD-T1…T6 are proposals, un-registered until AD phase opens). ⚠️ task-id churn: row renumbered F-20→F-25→F-26 under concurrent-session collisions (see STATE.md).

### F-29 — Admin-toppings page-plan set (4 docs, one folder) · 2026-07-19
**AC:** Folder holds the 4 slug-prefixed docs; `.md` is sole source of truth (each HTML footer says so); BE contract (5 endpoints incl. the public/`all` role-scoped split + server-joined `products[]`, 3-target cache fan-out, wire shapes in DB names) + FE plan (file map, state ownership, 4 named render branches, 16 numbered behaviors) + 12 reference defects designed out + AD-TOP task mapping; zero rule duplication (links owning docs incl. the customer-menu cache map + `admin_products` F-27 for the picker); all 3 HTML render both themes; indexes updated per Hard Rule 6.

```
**Notes:** ID collision avoided — `F-22` and `AD-T1/2/3` were already taken by the
parallel-session `admin_task_board`/`admin_training` plans, so this task took **F-29**
and the `AD-TOP-1…3` row prefix. Registered as a new row in TASKS.md (Phase F). ⚠ The
plan requests a `UNIQUE(name)` amendment to `DB_SCHEMA.md §4.1` (needed for the 409-dup
fix) — flagged for the C-1 migration task, **not** written into the schema by this
docs-only task (one fact, one home).
**Verdict:** AC met — marked ✅ in TASKS.md.

### F-17 — Admin-overview page-plan set (4 docs, one folder) · 2026-07-19
**AC:** Folder holds the 4 slug-prefixed docs; `.md` is sole source of truth (each HTML footer says so); BE contract (7 endpoints incl. the consolidated SSE channel, state machine, wire shapes) + FE plan (file map, state ownership, 13 numbered behaviors) + defects-designed-out + task mapping; zero rule duplication (links owning docs); all 3 HTML render both themes; indexes updated per Hard Rule 6

Source: 2 Explore agents digested the 10-doc reference corpus
`reference/docs/system/08_pages/admin/admin_overview/` (~2,800 lines) — one on page/BE/
loading/scenario, one on cross-component + cross-page dataflow and the COMPARISON
doc-vs-code audits.

**Key reconciliations (harness beats reference):** ① the reference's **two** realtime
channels (SSE doorbell + an ungated `WS /ws/orders-live?token=` that any parseable JWT
incl. `customer` could open) collapse to **one cookie-JWT, manager-gated SSE stream** —
kills the SEC hole structurally (F-5) and deletes 2 dead switch cases · ② **no cache
map** — orders are never cached (`BE_STATE §7`), Redis is pub/sub only here · ③
`POST /payments` takes `{order_id, method}` only, no client `amount` · ④ optimistic
status advance gains a **rollback** · ⑤ N+1 live-list enrichment → one batched fetch.
**11 reference defects designed out** (all 4 distinct 🔴 roots + the load-bearing 🟡s).
**Flags raised:** ⚠ cash-payment phase (COD now, gateways P) · ⚠ N+1 watch at AD-1 ·
❓ cancel rule still open in `OVERALL_PLAN §3.7` (plan assumes cancel from
pending/confirmed/preparing only).
**Verdict:** AC met — marked ✅ in TASKS.md. Admin is Session-0 deferred, so the plan
seeds future AD-1/AD-2/AD-3 rows and cross-links the R and P phases (no rows invented).

### F-19 — Customer order detail: merge ruling + supplement · 2026-07-19
**AC:** Supplement records the merge ruling, points at the real home, and owns the three
items the merge left unhomed (deep-link gap · stepper ruling · redirect drift); zero
duplication of the `/orders` plan; indexes updated per Hard Rule 6.

**What changed vs. the registered scope.** The task opened as a 4-doc page-plan set for
`/order/:id`. Two findings redirected it, both surfaced to the owner before any HTML was
rendered: (1) the sibling `customer_orders_tracking` plan **merges `/order/:id` away**,
and (2) it already specifies the detail view completely. Owner ruled *"merge — detail is
a view, not a route"*, then *"short supplement, retire the set"*. The drafted `_PLAN.md`
was therefore discarded (~90 % duplication — `PAGE_PLAN_GUIDE.md §10`) and replaced by a
126-line supplement. **No HTML companions were built, deliberately.**

**Receipt:**
```
$ ls harness/plans/customer_order_detail/ && wc -l harness/plans/customer_order_detail/*
customer_order_detail_PLAN.md          19    # stub: "no plan here", points at the home

$ grep -c "customer_orders_tracking" .../customer_order_detail_SUPPLEMENT.md

33:> **Superseded 2026-07-19 (F-19).** …   # §1 out-links  → /orders

$ grep -c "order/:id" harness/plans/customer_menu/customer_menu_PLAN.md
2                                            # both inside the supersession notes (they
                                             # explain the change); zero live stale refs

$ grep -c "customer_order_detail" harness/CONTEXT_MAP.md harness/README.md
harness/CONTEXT_MAP.md:2                     # Hard Rule 6 — a row per new file
harness/README.md:2
```

**Open items handed to the owner** (recorded in the supplement, not resolved here):
- 🚨 **Deep-link gap** — with `/order/:id` gone, detail is reachable only via
  `activeOrderId` in the persisted client store. A shared link, a QR re-scan on a second
  phone, a private tab, or a cleared store leaves a live order **unreachable**.
  Recommendation: `/orders?id=<uuid>` (URL wins over the store; existing `table_id` 403
  already covers a guessed id). Decide before the `/orders` FE row opens.
- ⚠️ **Quantity stepper** dropped by omission — `PATCH /orders/items/:id/quantity` is in
  the `/orders` plan's "Not built" list with no decision record. Default: stays dropped.
- ⚠️ **Duplicate task ids** from parallel sessions (F-17 ×2 during this session, since
  renumbered to F-27/F-28 by the sibling). Not fixed here — other sessions' in-flight rows.

**Verdict:** AC met (as re-scoped by the two owner rulings) — marked ✅ in TASKS.md.

### F-24 — Customer-favourites page-plan set (4 docs, one folder) · 2026-07-19
**AC:** Folder holds the 4 prefixed docs; `.md` is sole source of truth (each HTML footer says so); read-only 2-GET BE contract cross-links the menu plan (no re-derive); reference's empty≡loading≡error conflation designed out with named branches; DESIGN_PROMPT NEW features captured as flagged/deferred rows; both HTML themes render; indexes updated per Hard Rule 6

Mockup deliberately carries **no** theme tokens — per PAGE_PLAN_GUIDE §7 it hard-codes the
locked customer shell (`#0b0f17` / `#1b2230` / `#f97316`) so it renders identically in the
viewer's light and dark theme. Phone is `width:390px; max-width:100%` → no page-level
sideways scroll. Section counts match the guide: plan.html 9 (§5), how-it-works 7 (§6).

```
$ node --check <js extracted from mockup>      # 11001 chars
JS SYNTAX OK
$ grep -c 'ĐỀ XUẤT' mockup            8       # deferred C-7 proposals badged as proposals
$ grep -nE '--navh|padding-bottom' mockup
--navh:72px;  /* fixed bottom nav height — CTA must clear this */
#view-fav{padding-bottom:calc(var(--navh) + 132px)}   # B8: the reference's hidden-footer
#view-sets{padding-bottom:calc(var(--navh) + 24px)}   #      bug designed out, per view
#view-build{padding-bottom:calc(var(--navh) + 108px)}
```
Worked example is consistent across all 4 docs and JS-generated in the mockup from seed
data: Bánh Cuốn Thịt 4.000 ×2 + Bánh Trứng Vàng 9.000 ×1 + Combo Đầy Đặn 42.000 ×1
= **4 món · 59.000 đ**; sets 📋 Sáng thứ 7 (3 món · 88.000 đ) · 📋 Cả nhà (5 món · 152.000 đ).
`plan.html` carries the loading-branch fix (`isPending`/`isError` ×3 each) and the
zero-write BE emphasis; `how-it-works.html` has 9 inline SVG sequence diagrams.
Index rows added: CONTEXT_MAP §Doc inventory ×4 + harness/README §plans/ ×4 (Hard Rule 6).
**Not done (carried):** `harness/diagrams/task-F-24.html` (owner rule 2026-07-17, per-task
plan page) — the three render agents hit the account session limit; noted in STATE.md.
**Verdict:** AC met for the 4-doc set — marked ✅ in TASKS.md. Task-page rule outstanding.

### F-15 amendment — cart-store §04 (nhân · canh · combos + how Zustand works) · 2026-07-19
**AC:** owner asked to "add visual and explain what happen when client add select nhân/canh, add combos product, how zustand work" → a dedicated section on `how-it-works.html` with visuals, faithful to PLAN.md (page owns nothing), no structural drift.
**Receipt:**
```
$ grep -nE 'href="#(map|load|add|cart|state|order|redis)"|sec-num">[0-9]' how-it-works.html   # topnav 01–07 + sec-nums match, new #cart=04
  ...01 map · 02 load · 03 add · 04 cart · 05 state · 06 order · 07 redis

$ echo svg $(grep -c '<svg' …) / $(grep -c '</svg>' …)                # 8 / 8  (+1 new anatomy diagram)
$ echo div $(grep -o '<div' … | wc -l) / $(grep -o '</div>' … | wc -l) # 159 / 159 balanced
$ grep -nE '§0[0-9]' how-it-works.html   # all cross-refs resolve: §07 redis, §06 orders, §02/§03 valid — no stale §04/§05/§06
# headless-Chrome render → screenshot (dark theme):
#   scratchpad/how-it-works-s04.png (full) + s04-body.png (crop)
#   confirms: nhân pills (single vs multi + "min 1 🔒" lock), canh stepper, canh-gate flow,
#   Zustand anatomy SVG (STATE/ACTIONS/SELECTORS · writers→set() · subscribers←selector · persist→localStorage),
#   5-step write-cycle, both callouts — no layout breakage.
```
**Verdict:** AC met — content-only amendment to an inventoried file (Hard Rule 6 n/a: file purpose unchanged), committed straight to `main`.

### F-16 — Canonical DB schema from reference object models · 2026-07-18
**AC:** DB_SCHEMA.md specs all 13 spec-traced tables in column detail + stubs the phase-later tables; every reference mismatch flag has an explicit adopt/fix/drop ruling linked to the owning decision doc; OVERALL_PLAN §3.2 + customer_menu plan re-pointed (no duplicated schema facts); indexes updated per Hard Rule 6

**Verdict:** AC met — marked ✅ in TASKS.md.

### F-15 — Customer-menu page build plan (FE + BE, one folder) · 2026-07-18
**AC:** Folder holds one MD plan (FE + BE + API contract + task breakdown mapped to TASKS.md rows) and one HTML plan page rendering both themes covering FE and BE; zero rule duplication (links to owning docs); indexes updated per Hard Rule 6
**Receipt:**
```
$ ls harness/plans/customer_menu/
PLAN.md  plan.html                                  # exactly one MD + one HTML
$ python3 tag-balance-check plan.html task-F-15.html build-plan.html
plan.html        OPEN-UNCLOSED: none  MISMATCH: 0  SIZE: 49916
task-F-15.html   OPEN-UNCLOSED: none  MISMATCH: 0  SIZE: 10099
build-plan.html  OPEN-UNCLOSED: none  MISMATCH: 0  SIZE: 71372
VN strings in plan.html: True                       # Quán Bánh Cuốn · Thanh toán · SUẤT TỰ TẠO · Bàn 04 · 103.000 · Tìm món nhanh
PLAN.md lines: 286                                  # §3 BE (6 endpoints, schema slice, cache map)
                                                    # §4 FE (file map, state, 12 behaviors) §5 TASKS map §6 defects §7 flags
```
Both themes: plan.html + task-F-15.html use the house prefers-color-scheme + data-theme
override pattern (copied from task-F-13.html). Index rows added: CONTEXT_MAP §Doc
inventory ×3 + §Routing (page-plan read rule), harness/README §plans/ + task-F-15 row.
**Verdict:** AC met — marked ✅ in TASKS.md.

### F-14 — Docs alignment sweep · 2026-07-18
**AC:** CONTEXT_MAP §Doc inventory has a row for every doc area in the repo (PROMPTS.md, CONTEXT_MAP itself, root README, templates/, reference/, personal/); stale "reference untracked" flag cleared from STATE.md; harness/README task summary + root README folder layout match reality; TASKS.md Phase-F rows in id order; docs render
**Receipt:**
```
$ python3 f14-alignment-check   # coverage walk + tag-balance + order + stale-flag
harness files with no inventory row: none          # all 17 md + 14 html covered
inventory covers CLAUDE.md / root README / templates/ / reference/docs/ /
  personal/ / PROMPTS.md / CONTEXT_MAP.md (self): True ×7
task-F-14.html   errors: none | unclosed: none     # both themes styled
build-plan.html  errors: none | unclosed: none     # §R report entry added
Phase-F id order: [1..9, 11, 12, 13, 14] ascending: True
stale 'untracked reference' in resume point: False
```
Decision recorded (task-F-14.html §1): **no folder moves** — reference/docs paths are
load-bearing citations; reference/ is a read-only corpus. ⚠ flag left open for owner:
`personal/command.md` tracked against the Session-0b decision.
**Verdict:** AC met — marked ✅ in TASKS.md.

### F-13 — DevOps operations doc from reference/docs/devops · 2026-07-18
**AC:** Doc covers DevOps file ownership, compose/Dockerfile/Caddy patterns (our stack versions), CI/CD + image tagging, rollback procedures + severity/SLA, Stage A/B go-live runbook, backups, pre-deploy checklist, hard rules; zero facts duplicated from ENVIRONMENT.md (links instead); HTML renders
**Receipt:**
```
$ python3 htmlparser-walk (void-aware) devops.html task-F-13.html
harness/diagrams/devops.html     OK — no mismatches, no unclosed tags · themes: media-query + data-theme dark/light all present
harness/diagrams/task-F-13.html  OK — same
$ grep -c "3306\|6379" harness/DEVOPS.md
0        # no dev-port table duplicated; ENVIRONMENT.md linked in §Truth boundaries
$ grep -n "^## " harness/DEVOPS.md
→ §1 file ownership · §2 compose/startup · §3 image patterns (Go 1.26 distroless,
  Next 16 standalone/node22, MySQL 9.7, Redis 8) · §4 Caddy · §5 CI/CD + tagging
  (GHCR n-ecom-be/-fe, keep 2 tags) · §6 rollback (6A/6B + checklist) · §7 Stage A/B
  runbook · §8 backups · §9 severity/SLA · §10 pre-deploy checklist + D1–D8 rules
```
Every AC bullet maps to a section (1:1, listed above). Duplication check: commands/
ports/env-var lists stay in ENVIRONMENT.md (§Truth boundaries links them); strategy
facts (10-service target, 2-stage rationale) cited to OVERALL_PLAN §5, not restated.
Hard Rule 6 done: CONTEXT_MAP inventory rows (DEVOPS.md, devops.html, task-F-13.html)
+ Infra/DevOps routing row now reads `DEVOPS.md` first; README index rows added.
**Verdict:** AC met — marked ✅ in TASKS.md. (Task renumbered F-10 → F-13 mid-register
after the three-session id collision; see F-12 receipt note.)

### F-11 — BE engineering playbook from reference/docs/be · 2026-07-18
**AC:** Playbook covers goose+sqlc data-layer workflow, migration-file standard, Go/Gin gotcha rules, caching discipline adds, BE build order, seed/smoke tooling rule, code-summary doc rule; zero duplication with BE_STATE/ARCHITECTURE (links instead); task page renders both themes
**Receipt:**
```
$ python3 tagcheck.py task-F-11.html build-plan.html   # HTMLParser walk, void-aware
harness/diagrams/task-F-11.html  -> errors: none | unclosed: none
harness/diagrams/build-plan.html -> errors: none | unclosed: none
$ grep -c 'prefers-color-scheme\|data-theme="dark"\|data-theme="light"' task-F-11.html
3   # media query + both explicit theme overrides present
$ grep -n "^## " harness/BE_PLAYBOOK.md
1 data-layer workflow (goose+sqlc) · 2 migration-file standard · 3 Go/Gin gotcha rules ·
4 caching discipline adds · 5 BE build order · 6 seed+smoke tooling · 7 code-summary docs
$ grep -i "VALIDATION_FAILED\|INSUFFICIENT_STOCK\|cache-aside\|write-through" BE_PLAYBOOK.md
(no hits — error enum, tx policy and cache policy are linked, not restated)
```
**Verdict:** AC met — marked ✅ in TASKS.md.

### F-12 — FE code-convention rules from reference/docs/fe · 2026-07-18
**AC:** FE_STATE.md hard-rule list covers the 7 convention gaps with no duplication of OVERALL_PLAN §6 lessons; cart-pivot drift flagged in place; ENVIRONMENT.md carries the JIT rebuild note; docs render
**Receipt:**
```
$ python3 tagcheck.py task-F-12.html build-plan.html   # HTMLParser walk, void-aware
harness/diagrams/task-F-12.html  -> errors: none | unclosed: none
harness/diagrams/build-plan.html -> errors: none | unclosed: none
$ grep -n "^[0-9]" harness/FE_STATE.md §9 → rule numbers 1..14 all present (8–14 new)
$ grep -n "Superseded 2026-07-18" harness/FE_STATE.md → §1 supersession note (F-9 cart pivot)
$ grep -n "Tailwind JIT scans source" harness/ENVIRONMENT.md → §Commands rebuild gotcha
```
Duplication check: rules 8–14 are code-level conventions absent from OVERALL_PLAN §6
(behavioral lessons), FE_STATE §1–8, ARCHITECTURE gates (gate 8 is shape-sync; rule 10
adds naming), design-system.html (owns token *values*, rule 8 owns the ban). Hard Rule 6
done: CONTEXT_MAP + README rows updated (FE_STATE purpose + task-F-12.html).
**Verdict:** AC met — marked ✅ in TASKS.md. ⚠️ F-10/F-10/F-10 id collision with two
parallel sessions resolved as F-11 (BE playbook) / F-12 (this) / F-13 (DevOps).

### F-9 — Overall build plan from reference/08_pages · 2026-07-17
**AC:** Plan covers all 4 role surfaces (public/customer/staff/admin), BE service/endpoint map, FE page/phase map, DevOps pipeline, phased task breakdown reconciled with existing TASKS.md phases; MD complete + HTML renders
**Receipt:**
```
$ python3 tagcheck.py overall-plan.html task-F-9.html   # HTMLParser walk, void-aware
harness/diagrams/overall-plan.html -> errors: none | unclosed: none
harness/diagrams/task-F-9.html     -> errors: none | unclosed: none
$ grep -n "^## " harness/OVERALL_PLAN.md
1 Product definition (4 surfaces) · 2 Scope delta · 3 Backend plan (domains/schema/
API/auth/realtime/Redis/rules) · 4 Frontend plan · 5 DevOps plan · 6 Lessons register ·
7 Deferred · 8 Phased roadmap + TASKS.md reconciliation · 9 Open decisions
```
Reconciliation check: every ⬜/⛔ TASKS.md row re-homed in §8 (F-2/3/4 unchanged ·
C-1…C-5 kept · CC-1/2 superseded, CC-3/4/5 → O phase · O-1…3 kept · A-1/2 → S phase,
A-3 → ON phase · ⛔ Admin → AD · ⛔ Payment → P). Inputs: 4 parallel Explore-agent
digests of `reference/docs/system/` (~53k lines). Both themes render (prefers-color-scheme
+ data-theme overrides present in both files).
**Verdict:** AC met — marked ✅ in TASKS.md. ⚠️ scope-pivot flag open for owner (OVERALL_PLAN.md §9).

### F-8 — BE state & data architecture doc · 2026-07-17
**AC:** Doc covers BE state kinds w/ owners, request data flow, transaction policy, error-code enum + mapping, validation tiers, folder layout, hard BE rules; HTML diagram renders
