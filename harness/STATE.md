# STATE.md — Durable State / Checkpoint Log (Primitive 6)

> The workbench. Any session — after a crash, compaction, or handoff — resumes from
> THIS file, not from memory. Update it before ending every session (checkpoint discipline).
> Newest entry on top. Keep each checkpoint ≤ 10 lines; archive old entries yearly.

## Current resume point

- **Status:** ✅ Session 0 done — all foundation decisions taken, phases broken into tasks.
- **Next:** F-2 (dev stack skeleton) — prompt ready in `PROMPTS.md`.
- **Open decisions:** none blocking. Deferred (not open): payment gateway, Admin, AI assistant.

## Checkpoint log

### 2026-07-16 — Session 0b (F-1): foundation decisions
- Done: F-1 ✅ (receipt in VERIFICATION.md).
- Decisions: Go 1.25+Gin+sqlc+MySQL 8+Redis · Next.js App Router+TS strict+Tailwind+
  Zustand+TanStack Query+RHF/Zod · Compose+Caddy+GH Actions · **Payment deferred**
  (v1 = COD, lifecycle placed→confirmed→shipped→delivered/cancelled) · Admin + AI
  deferred · v1 domains = Catalog/Cart/Checkout/Orders/Accounts · error envelope
  `{"error":{code,message,details}}` · business rules 1–5 proposed in PLAN.md.
- Drift fixed / found: repo was not a git repo → `git init`, branch `main`, checkpoint
  commit `0b727a8`; `personal.md` gitignored (not project material — owner may override).
- Next: F-2 — compose stack, hello-world BE+FE, healthcheck.

### 2026-07-16 — Session 0a: core created
- ecom-core harness scaffolded from the 10-primitive model (based on the
  restaurant project's chat-feature harness).
- Decisions taken: harness structure = one file per primitive under `harness/`;
  skills = start-task / finish-task / handoff.
- Nothing built yet. No receipts yet.

<!-- TEMPLATE — copy for each session:
